# Vital concept to understand are "Components" - a component is a collection of files to be installed.
# Any file to be packaged for installation must be part of a component - note the COMPONENT flag for
# "install". CPack then includes it in the generated package, to be installed at the destination
# specified in the "install" (plus a CPack-only prefix set below).
#
# Components are intended to be self-contained, as they may be installed individually. Components also
# smap directly to the options made visible to the user in the installer.
