      exercising permissions granted by this License.\line
\line
      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,\line
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation\line
      source, and configuration files.\line
\line
      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical\line
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but\line
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,\line
      and conversions to other media types.\line
\line
      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or\line
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a\line
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work\line
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).\line
\line
      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object\line
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the\line
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications\line
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes\line
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain\line
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,\line
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.\line
\line
      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including\line
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions\line
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally\line
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner\line
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of\line
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"\line
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent\line
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to\line
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,\line
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the\line
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but\line
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise\line
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."\line
\line
      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity\line
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and\line
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.\line
\line
   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of\line
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,\line
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable\line
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,\line
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the\line
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.\line
\line
   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of\line
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,\line
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable\line
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,\line
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,\line
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable\line
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their\line
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)\line
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You\line
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\line
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\line
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\line
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\line
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\line
      as of the date such litigation is filed.\line
\line
   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\line
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\line
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\line
      meet the following conditions:\line
\line
      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\line
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\line
\line
      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\line
          stating that You changed the files; and\line
\line
      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\line
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\line
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\line
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\line
          the Derivative Works; and\line
\line
      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its\line
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\line
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\line
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\line
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\line
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\line
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\line
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\line
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\line
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\line
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\line
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\line
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\line
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\line
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\line
          as modifying the License.\line
\line
      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\line
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\line
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\line
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\line
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\line
      the conditions stated in this License.\line
\line
   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\line
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\line
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\line
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\line
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\line
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\line
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\line
\line
   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\line
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\line
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\line
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\line
\line
   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\line
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\line
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,\line
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\line
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\line
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\line
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\line
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\line
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\line
\line
   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\line
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\line
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\line
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\line
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\line
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\line
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\line
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\line
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\line
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\line
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\line
\line
   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\line
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\line
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\line
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\line
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\line
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\line
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\line
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\line
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\line
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\line

{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 \f1             GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\line
               Version 3, 29 June 2007\line
\line
 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>\line
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\line
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\line
\line
                Preamble\line
\line
  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for\line
software and other kinds of works.\line
\line
  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed\line
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,\line
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\line
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\line
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\line
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\line
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\line
your programs, too.\line
\line
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\line
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\line
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\line
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\line
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\line
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.\line
\line
  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\line
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\line
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\line
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\line
\line
  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\line
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\line
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\line
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\line
know their rights.\line
\line
  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\line
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\line
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\line
\line
  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\line
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\line
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\line
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\line
authors of previous versions.\line
\line
  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\line
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\line
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\line
protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\line
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\line
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\line
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\line
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\line
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\line
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\line
\line
  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\line
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\line
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\line
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\line
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\line
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\line
\line
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\line
modification follow.\line
\line
               TERMS AND CONDITIONS\line
\line
  0. Definitions.\line
\line
  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\line
\line
  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\line
works, such as semiconductor masks.\line
\line
  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\line
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and\line
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.\line
\line
  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\line
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\line
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the\line
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.\line
\line
  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\line
on the Program.\line
\line
  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without\line
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\line
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\line
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\line
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the\line
public, and in some countries other activities as well.\line
\line
  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\line
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\line
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\line
\line
  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"\line
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\line
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\line
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\line
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\line
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\line
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\line
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\line
\line
  1. Source Code.\line
\line
  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work\line
for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source\line
form of a work.\line
\line
  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official\line
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\line
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\line
is widely used among developers working in that language.\line
\line
  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other\line
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\line
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\line
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\line
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\line
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\line
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component\line
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\line
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\line
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\line
\line
  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all\line
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\line
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\line
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\line
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\line
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\line
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\line
includes interface definition files associated with source files for\line
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\line
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\line
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\line
subprograms and other parts of the work.\line
\line
  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\line
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\line
Source.\line
\line
  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\line
same work.\line
\line
  2. Basic Permissions.\line
\line
  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\line
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\line
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\line
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\line
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\line
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\line
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\line
\line
  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\line
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\line
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\line
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\line
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\line
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\line
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\line
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\line
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\line
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\line
\line
  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\line
the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\line
makes it unnecessary.\line
\line
  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\line
\line
  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\line
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\line
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\line
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\line
measures.\line
\line
  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\line
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\line
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\line
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\line
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\line
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\line
technological measures.\line
\line
  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\line
\line
  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\line
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\line
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\line
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any\line
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\line
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\line
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\line
\line
  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\line
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\line
\line
  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\line
\line
  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\line
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\line
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\line
\line
    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\line
    it, and giving a relevant date.\line
\line
    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\line
    released under this License and any conditions added under section\line
    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\line
    "keep intact all notices".\line
\line
    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\line
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\line
    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\line
    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\line
    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\line
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\line
    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\line
\line
    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\line
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\line
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\line
    work need not make them do so.\line
\line
  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\line
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\line
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\line
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\line
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\line
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\line
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\line
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\line
parts of the aggregate.\line
\line
  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\line
\line
  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\line
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\line
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\line
in one of these ways:\line
\line
    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\line
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\line
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\line
    customarily used for software interchange.\line
\line
    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\line
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\line
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\line
    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\line
    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\line
    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\line
    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\line
    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\line
    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\line
    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\line
    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\line
\line
    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\line
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\line
    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\line
    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\line
    with subsection 6b.\line
\line
    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\line
    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\line
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\line
    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\line
    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\line
    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\line
    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\line
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\line
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\line
    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\line
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\line
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\line
\line
    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\line
    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\line
    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\line
    charge under subsection 6d.\line
\line
  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\line
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\line
included in conveying the object code work.\line
\line
  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any\line
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\line
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\line
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\line
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\line
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a\line
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\line
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\line
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\line
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\line
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\line
the only significant mode of use of the product.\line
\line
  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,\line
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\line
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\line
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\line
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\line
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\line
modification has been made.\line
\line
  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\line
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\line
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\line
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\line
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\line
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\line
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\line
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\line
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\line
been installed in ROM).\line
\line
  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\line
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\line
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\line
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\line
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and\line
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\line
protocols for communication across the network.\line
\line
  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\line
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\line
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in\line
source code form), and must require no special password or key for\line
unpacking, reading or copying.\line
\line
  7. Additional Terms.\line
\line
  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this\line
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\line
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\line
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\line
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\line
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\line
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\line
this License without regard to the additional permissions.\line
\line
  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\line
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\line
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\line
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\line
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\line
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\line
\line
  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\line
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\line
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\line
\line
    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\line
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\line
\line
    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\line
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\line
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\line
\line
    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\line
    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\line
    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\line
\line
    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\line
    authors of the material; or\line
\line
    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\line
    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\line
\line
    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\line
    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\line
    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\line
    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\line
    those licensors and authors.\line
\line
  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further\line
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\line
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\line
governed by this License along with a term that is a further\line
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\line
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\line
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\line
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does\line
not survive such relicensing or conveying.\line
\line
  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\line
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\line
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\line
where to find the applicable terms.\line
\line
  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\line
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\line
the above requirements apply either way.\line
\line
  8. Termination.\line
\line
  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\line
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\line
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\line
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\line
paragraph of section 11).\line
\line
  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\line
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\line
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\line
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\line
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\line
prior to 60 days after the cessation.\line
\line
  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\line
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\line
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\line
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\line
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\line
your receipt of the notice.\line
\line
  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\line
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\line
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\line
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\line
material under section 10.\line
\line
  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\line
\line
  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\line
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\line
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\line
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\line
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\line
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\line
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\line
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\line
\line
  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\line
\line
  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\line
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\line
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\line
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\line
\line
  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an\line
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\line
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\line
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that\line
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\line
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\line
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\line
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\line
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\line
\line
  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\line
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\line
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\line
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\line
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\line
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\line
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\line
\line
  11. Patents.\line
\line
  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\line
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\line
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".\line
\line
  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims\line
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\line
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\line
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\line
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\line
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\line
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant\line
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\line
this License.\line
\line
  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\line
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\line
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\line
propagate the contents of its contributor version.\line
\line
  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express\line
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\line
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\line
sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a\line
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\line
patent against the party.\line
\line
  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\line
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\line
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\line
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\line
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\line
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\line
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\line
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\line
license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have\line
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\line
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\line
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\line
country that you have reason to believe are valid.\line
\line
  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\line
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\line
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\line
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\line
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\line
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\line
work and works based on it.\line
\line
  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within\line
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\line
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\line
specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\line
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\line
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\line
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\line
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\line
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\line
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\line
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\line
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that\line
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\line
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\line
\line
  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\line
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\line
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\line
\line
  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\line
\line
  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\line
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\line
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\line
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\line
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\line
not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\line
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\line
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\line
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\line
\line
  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\line
\line
  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\line
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\line
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\line
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\line
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\line
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\line
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\line
combination as such.\line
\line
  14. Revised Versions of this License.\line
\line
  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\line
the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\line
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\line
address new problems or concerns.\line
\line
  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\line
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\line
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the\line
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\line
version or of any later version published by the Free Software\line
Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\line
GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\line
by the Free Software Foundation.\line
\line
  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\line
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\line
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\line
to choose that version for the Program.\line
\line
  Later license versions may give you additional or different\line
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\line
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\line
later version.\line
\line
  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\line
\line
  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\line
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\line
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY\line
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\line
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\line
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\line
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\line
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\line
\line
  16. Limitation of Liability.\line
\line
  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\line
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\line
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\line
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\line
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\line

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.,\line
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA\line
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\line
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\line
\line
                Preamble\line
\line
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\line
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\line
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\line
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\line
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software\line
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\line
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\line
the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\line
your programs, too.\line
\line
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\line
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\line
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\line
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\line
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\line
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\line
\line
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\line
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\line
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\line
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\line
\line
  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\line
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\line
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\line
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\line
rights.\line
\line
  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\line
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\line
distribute and/or modify the software.\line
\line
  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\line
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\line
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\line
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\line
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\line
authors' reputations.\line
\line
  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\line
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\line
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\line
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\line
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\line
\line
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\line
modification follow.\line
\line
            GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\line
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\line
\line
  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\line
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\line
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,\line
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"\line
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\line
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\line
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\line
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\line
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".\line
\line
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\line
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\line
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\line
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\line
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).\line
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.\line
\line
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\line
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\line
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\line
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\line
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\line
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\line
along with the Program.\line
\line
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\line
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\line
\line
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\line
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\line
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\line
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\line
\line
    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\line
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\line
\line
    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\line
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\line
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\line
    parties under the terms of this License.\line
\line
    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\line
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\line
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\line
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\line
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\line
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\line
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\line
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\line
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\line
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\line
\line
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\line
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\line
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\line
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\line
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\line
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\line
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\line
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\line
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\line
\line
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\line
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\line
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\line
collective works based on the Program.\line
\line
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\line
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\line
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\line
the scope of this License.\line
\line
  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\line
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\line
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\line
\line
    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\line
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\line
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\line
\line
    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\line
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\line
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\line
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\line
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\line
    customarily used for software interchange; or,\line
\line
    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\line
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\line
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\line
    received the program in object code or executable form with such\line
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\line
\line
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\line
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\line
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\line
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\line
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\line
special exception, the source code distributed need not include\line
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\line
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\line
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\line
itself accompanies the executable.\line
\line
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\line
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\line
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as\line
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\line
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\line
\line
  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\line
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\line
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\line
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\line
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\line
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\line
parties remain in full compliance.\line
\line
  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\line
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\line
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\line
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\line
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\line
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\line
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\line
the Program or works based on it.\line
\line
  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\line
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\line
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\line
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\line
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\line
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\line
this License.\line
\line
  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\line
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\line
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\line
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\line
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\line
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\line
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\line
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\line
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\line
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\line
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\line
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\line
\line
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\line
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\line
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\line
circumstances.\line
\line
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\line
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\line
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\line
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is\line
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\line
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\line
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\line
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\line
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\line
impose that choice.\line
\line
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\line
be a consequence of the rest of this License.\line
\line
  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\line
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\line
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License\line
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\line
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\line
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\line
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\line
\line
  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\line
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\line
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\line
address new problems or concerns.\line
\line
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\line
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any\line
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\line
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free\line
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\line
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\line
Foundation.\line
\line
  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\line
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\line
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\line
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\line
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\line
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\line
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\line
\line
                NO WARRANTY\line
\line
  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\line
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\line
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\line
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\line
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\line
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\line
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\line
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\line
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\line
\line
  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\line
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\line
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\line
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\line
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\line
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\line
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\line
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\line
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\line

 Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\line
     59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA\line
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\line
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\line
\line
[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts\line
 as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\line
 the version number 2.1.]\line
\line
                Preamble\line
\line
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\line
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\line
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\line
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\line
\line
  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\line
specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\line
Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You\line
can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\line
this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\line
strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.\line
\line
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\line
not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\line
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\line
for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\line
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\line
it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\line
these things.\line
\line
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\line
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\line
rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\line
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\line
\line
  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\line
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\line
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\line
code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\line
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\line
with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\line
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\line
\line
  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\line
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\line
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\line
\line
  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\line
there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\line
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\line
that what they have is not the original version, so that the original\line
author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\line
introduced by others.\line
\line
  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\line
any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\line
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\line
restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\line
any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\line
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\line
\line
  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\line
ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\line
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\line
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\line
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\line
libraries into non-free programs.\line
\line
  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\line
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\line
combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\line
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\line
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\line
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\line
the library.\line
\line
  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it\line
does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\line
Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\line
of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\line
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\line
libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\line
special circumstances.\line
\line
  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\line
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes\line
a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be\line
allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\line
library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\line
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\line
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\line
\line
  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\line
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\line
free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\line
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\line
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\line
system.\line
\line
  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\line
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\line
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\line
that program using a modified version of the Library.\line
\line
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\line
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\line
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The\line
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\line
be combined with the library in order to run.\line
\line
          GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\line
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\line
\line
  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other\line
program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\line
other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\line
this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").\line
Each licensee is addressed as "you".\line
\line
  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data\line
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\line
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\line
\line
  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work\line
which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the\line
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under\line
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\line
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\line
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\line
included without limitation in the term "modification".)\line
\line
  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\line
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\line
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\line
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation\line
and installation of the library.\line
\line
  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\line
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\line
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\line
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\line
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\line
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\line
and what the program that uses the Library does.\line
\line
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\line
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\line
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\line
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\line
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\line
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\line
Library.\line
\line
  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\line
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\line
fee.\line
\line
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\line
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\line
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\line
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\line
\line
    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\line
\line
    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\line
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\line
\line
    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\line
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\line
\line
    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\line
    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\line
    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\line
    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\line
    in the event an application does not supply such function or\line
    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\line
    its purpose remains meaningful.\line
\line
    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\line
    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\line
    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\line
    application-supplied function or table used by this function must\line
    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\line
    root function must still compute square roots.)\line
\line
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\line
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\line
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\line
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\line
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\line
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\line
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\line
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\line
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\line
it.\line
\line
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\line
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\line
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\line
collective works based on the Library.\line
\line
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\line
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\line
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\line
the scope of this License.\line
\line
  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\line
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\line
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\line
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\line
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\line
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\line
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\line
these notices.\line
\line
  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\line
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\line
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\line
\line
  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\line
the Library into a program that is not a library.\line
\line
  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\line
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\line
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\line
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\line
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\line
medium customarily used for software interchange.\line
\line
  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\line
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\line
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\line
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not\line
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\line
\line
  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\line
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\line
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a\line
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\line
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.\line
\line
  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library\line
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\line
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the\line
library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\line
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\line
\line
  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file\line
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\line
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\line
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\line
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\line
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\line
\line
  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\line
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\line
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\line
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\line
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\line
Library will still fall under Section 6.)\line
\line
  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\line
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\line
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\line
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\line
\line
  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\line
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a\line
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\line
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\line
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\line
engineering for debugging such modifications.\line
\line
  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\line
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\line
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\line
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\line
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\line
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\line
of these things:\line
\line
    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\line
    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\line
    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\line
    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\line
    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that\line
    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the\line
    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\line
    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\line
    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\line
    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\line
    to use the modified definitions.)\line
\line
    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\line
    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\line
    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\line
    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\line
    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\line
    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is\line
    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\line
\line
    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at\line
    least three years, to give the same user the materials\line
    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more\line
    than the cost of performing this distribution.\line
\line
    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\line
    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\line
    specified materials from the same place.\line
\line
    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\line
    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\line
\line
  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the\line
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for\line
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\line
the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\line
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\line
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\line
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\line
the executable.\line
\line
  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\line
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\line
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\line
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you\line
distribute.\line
\line
  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\line
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library\line
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\line
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\line
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\line
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:\line
\line
    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\line
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\line
    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\line
    Sections above.\line
\line
    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\line
    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\line
    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\line
\line
  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\line
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\line
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\line
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\line
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\line
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\line
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\line
\line
  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\line
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\line
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\line
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\line
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\line
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\line
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\line
the Library or works based on it.\line
\line
  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\line
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\line
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\line
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\line
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\line
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\line
this License.\line
\line
  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\line
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\line
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\line
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\line
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\line
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\line
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\line
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\line
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\line
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\line
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\line
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\line
\line
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\line
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,\line
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\line
\line
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\line
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\line
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\line
integrity of the free software distribution system which is\line
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\line
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\line
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\line
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\line
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\line
impose that choice.\line
\line
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\line
be a consequence of the rest of this License.\line
\line
  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\line
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\line
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add\line
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,\line
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus\line
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if\line
written in the body of this License.\line
\line
  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\line
versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\line
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\line
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\line
\line
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\line
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\line
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and\line
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by\line
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\line
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by\line
the Free Software Foundation.\line
\line
  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\line
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\line
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\line
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\line
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\line
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\line
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\line
and reuse of software generally.\line
\line
                NO WARRANTY\line
\line
  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\line
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\line
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\line
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\line
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\line
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\line
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\line
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\line
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\line
\line
  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\line
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\line
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\line
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\line
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\line
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\line
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\line
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\line
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\line
DAMAGES.\line

                       Version 3, 29 June 2007\line
\line
 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>\line
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\line
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\line
\line
\line
  This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates\line
the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public\line
License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.\line
\line
  0. Additional Definitions.\line
\line
  As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser\line
General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU\line
General Public License.\line
\line
  "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,\line
other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.\line
\line
  An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided\line
by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.\line
Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode\line
of using an interface provided by the Library.\line
\line
  A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an\line
Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library\line
with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked\line
Version".\line
\line
  The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the\line
Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code\line
for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are\line
based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.\line
\line
  The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the\line
object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data\line
and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the\line
Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.\line
\line
  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\line
\line
  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License\line
without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\line
\line
  2. Conveying Modified Versions.\line
\line
  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a\line
facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application\line
that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the\line
facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified\line
version:\line
\line
   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to\line
   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the\line
   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs\line
   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or\line
\line
   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of\line
   this License applicable to that copy.\line
\line
  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.\line
\line
  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from\line
a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object\line
code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated\line
material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure\line
layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates\line
(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:\line
\line
   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the\line
   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\line
   covered by this License.\line
\line
   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\line
   document.\line
\line
  4. Combined Works.\line
\line
  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,\line
taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the\line
portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse\line
engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of\line
the following:\line
\line
   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that\line
   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\line
   covered by this License.\line
\line
   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\line
   document.\line
\line
   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during\line
   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among\line
   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the\line
   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.\line
\line
   d) Do one of the following:\line
\line
       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this\line
       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form\line
       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to\line
       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of\line
       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the\line
       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying\line
       Corresponding Source.\line
\line
       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\line
       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time\line
       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer\line
       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version\line
       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked\line
       Version.\line
\line
   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise\line
   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the\line
   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is\line
   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the\line
   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the\line
   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If\line
   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany\line
   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application\line
   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation\line
   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL\line
   for conveying Corresponding Source.)\line
\line
  5. Combined Libraries.\line
\line
  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\line
Library side by side in a single library together with other library\line
facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this\line
License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your\line
choice, if you do both of the following:\line
\line
   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based\line
   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,\line
   conveyed under the terms of this License.\line
\line
   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it\line
   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the\line
   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\line
\line
  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.\line
\line
  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\line
of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new\line
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\line
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\line
\line
  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the\line
Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version\line
of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version"\line
applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and\line
conditions either of that published version or of any later version\line
published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you\line
received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser\line
General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser\line
General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\line
\line
  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide\line
whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall\line
apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is\line
permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the\line
Library.\par}
