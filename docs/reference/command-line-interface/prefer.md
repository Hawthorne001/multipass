The `prefer` command, introduced in Multipass release 1.11.0,  is used to switch alias contexts. It accepts a single argument, specifying the name of the context to switch to.

For example, the command `multipass prefer secondary` makes `secondary` the current context. If the given context does not exist, Multipass creates it.

Subsequent calls to [`alias`](/reference/command-line-interface/alias) , [`unalias`](/reference/command-line-interface/unalias) and running any aliases from the command line will use the aliases defined in the given context.
