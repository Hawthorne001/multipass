The `multipass recover` command will revive an instance that was previously removed with `multipass delete`. For this to be possible, the instance cannot have been purged with `multipass purge` nor with `multipass delete --purge`.

Use the `--all` option to recover all deleted instances at once:

```{code-block} text
multipass recover --all
```

---

The full `multipass help restart` output explains the available options:

```{code-block} text
