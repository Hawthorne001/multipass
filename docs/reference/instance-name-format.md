Instance names must be valid, non-qualified host names, and thus conform to a specific format; in particular:
* The instance name can only include alphanumeric characters or hyphens (e.g. `desirable-earwig`).
* The first character must be an alphabetic letter.
* The last character must be alphanumeric.
