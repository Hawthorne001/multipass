Multipass can be configured with a number of **settings** that are read and written by the [`get`](/reference/command-line-interface/get) and [`set`](/reference/command-line-interface/set) CLI commands, respectively. Some settings are also available in the [GUI client](/reference/gui-client).

<!-- Moved explanation of settings keys and values to a separate page, and added link to "See also" above -->

## Available settings

At any given time, the available settings depend on the state of the system. Some settings are only available on some platforms, while daemon settings can only be accessed when the Multipass daemon itself can be reached.

Some instance properties are also exposed as settings.

The command `multipass get --keys` shows what settings are available at any given time.

As of now, this is the total set of settings available:

- [client.apps.windows-terminal.profiles](client-apps-windows-terminal-profiles)
- [client.primary-name](client-primary-name)
- [local.bridged-network](local-bridged-network)
- [local.driver](local-driver)
- [local.\<instance-name>.bridged](local-instance-name-bridged)
- [local.\<instance-name>.cpus](local-instance-name-cpus)
- [local.\<instance-name>.disk](local-instance-name-disk)
- [local.\<instance-name>.memory](local-instance-name-memory)
- [local.\<instance-name>.\<snapshot-name>.comment](local-instance-name-snapshot-name-comment)
- [local.\<instance-name>.\<snapshot-name>.name](local-instance-name-snapshot-name-name)
- [local.passphrase](local-passphrase)
- [local.privileged-mounts](local-privileged-mounts)

```{caution}
Starting from Multipass version 1.14, the following settings have been removed from the CLI and are only available in the [GUI client](/reference/gui-client):
- [`client.gui.autostart`](client-gui-autostart)
- [`client.gui.hotkey`](client-gui-hotkey)
```

<!-- keeping the documentation pages for now, since not everyone will update their Multipass package immediately -->
